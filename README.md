# Drug Design AutoDock Tools MBP/D-Ribose

Molecular Docking 

Molecular docking is one of the molecular modeling methods that predicts the preferred orientation of one molecule (ligand) to another (receptor) when bound to each other to form a stable complex (lowest energy state).

Apply a molecular docking on a ligand-receptor interaction.

The name of the receptor : 

Maltose-binding periplasmic protein (MBP)

The functionality/type/aim of the receptor (Research, provide a reference) : 

Functionality: 

Maltose-binding protein (MBP) is a part of the maltose/maltodextrin system of Escherichia coli, which is responsible for the uptake and efficient catabolism of 
maltodextrins. It is a complex regulatory and transport system involving many proteins and protein complexes. 

Type: 

Maltose binding proteins (MBPs) are ubiquitous periplasmic binding proteins that serve as the primary receptors for alpha-linked glucose based oligosaccharides. While many bacteria have only a single copy of a more promiscuous MBP, some organisms contain more than one MBP isoform. 

Aim: 

Maltose Binding Protein Localization. The signal peptide of MBP serves two purposes. It slows the folding of the polypeptide and it helps it get to the membrane. 
Once the folding has taken place, the precursor can't enter in the translocation pathway. This causes a residue within the core to block the export.
